This package contains a set of Python tools for working with the Gooch

installed with `setup.py`. In addition to the `gooch_housego` Python
module which provides programmatic access to the driver, the tools
include,

 * `aotf-ui`: A small Gtk+ interface for configuring the driver's
   parameters.
 * `aotf-config`: A command-line utility for configuring the driver's
   parameters
